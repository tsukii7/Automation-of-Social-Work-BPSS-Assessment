305,I can't seem to forgive myself.,,,
305,I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.,,,
306,I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes.,,,
306,How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?,,,
307,I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough.,,,
307,I put 100% in to every thing.,,,
307,"I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise.",,,
307,I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from.,,,
307,Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works.,,,
307,"Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless.",,,
307,Any suggestions or ideas?,,,
308,It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times.,,,
308,"I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up.",,,
308,"I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic.",,,

308,"My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal.",,,
308,I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness?,,,
308,Hate?,,,
308,"He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that.",,,
308,I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore.,,,

310,She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her.,,,
310,I have trust issues.,,,
310,"Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along.",,,
310,I don't think she's happy.,,,
310,"She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay.",,,
310,"I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish.",,,
310,"I never believed in the whole ""If you love them, let them go,"" but I do now.",,,
310,I really want her to be happy.,,,

315,I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times.,,,
315,Now can I try but don't stop.,,,
315,At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them.,,,
315,How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head?,,,

321,I'm not a family-oriented person.,,,
321,I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.,,,
321,My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is.,,,
321,We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him.,,,
321,This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother.,,,
321,I hate her.,,,
321,"All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.",,,
321,I need guidance in my life.,,,

322,I was very embarrassed.,,,
323,On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs.,,,
323,I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out.,,,

348,I didn¡¯t find out about the messages until last month and that was six months after it happened.,,,
348,I can¡¯t trust him anymore and I'm just wondering if I ever will.,,,
348,He admitted that he wanted to have sex with her but he didn't.,,,
348,He was only talking with her because he thought we were going to have a break up.,,,
348,My heart is completely broken.,,,
348,I feel like I'm in competition with every girl on the planet for my boyfriend¡¯s affection.,,,
348,"I'm afraid that he doesn't like me anymore, but without me he's homeless and without a car.",,,
348,I love him so much.,,,
348,It's been tearing me apart.,,,
348,I don't feel pretty anymore though.,,,
348,I don't feel good enough for anyone or anything.,,,
348,I thought I knew him as well as I knew myself.,,,
348,Then all of a sudden my world was flipped upside down.,,,
348,I'm still trying to figure out which way is up.,,,
349,I'm going through a majorly bad divorce and my wife is making things so impossible for me.,,,
349,I need help.,,,
350,About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why.,,,
350,For me it seemed out of the blue.,,,
350,"I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family.",,,
350,I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed.,,,
350,"Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down.",,,
350,I haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart.,,,
350,I'm scared to because I don't want it to be taken away from me again.,,,
350,I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day.,,,
350,I just don't know what to do.,,,
350,I'm working at a place I know I should enjoy.,,,
350,"I'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc.",,,
350,"I'm doing everything the books say I should do, but I don't feel any different.",,,
350,I just don't know what to do.,,,
351,I feel like I have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around?,,,
351,It started after I got raped by my ex-boyfriend.,,,
352,"I keep hearing I am attractive from people around me, and I think I believe it.",,,
352,But I have low confidence regarding approaching girls I like.,,,
353,A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time.,,,
353,We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy.,,,
353,"She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc.",,,
353,I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning.,,,
353,"Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her.",,,
353,So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter.,,,
353,I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.,,,
354,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,,,
355,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup.,,,
355,Everything is a constant reminder.,,,
355,How do I move on?,,,
356,"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before.",,,
356,"I feel like I don't want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him.",,,
356,I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered "wrong" by a lot of people.,,,
356,How can I get myself to just move on?,,,
357,"Our relationship ended about 7 years ago, but don't know how to let go.",,,
357,How can I get over that person and move on?,,,
358,My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and it's all sudden.,,,
358,I understand that marriages have their ups and downs but I don't understand why she can't tell me why she wants a divorce.,,,
358,Should I fight for my family (daughter and wife)?,,,
359,We've been seeing each other for six years.,,,
359,"She has a teenage daughter, and she don't want to break the family up.",,,
360,"He had a sexual relationship with his sister and kept it from me for years, I confronted about it and he finally told me what happened.",,,
360,But I dont think he is telling me the whole story.,,,
360,He works with her and sees her every day.,,,
360,"I feel that I shouldn't stay with him , but he says he ended it long time ago.",,,
360,Should I trust my husband and stay with him?,,,
361,My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me.,,,
361,"He says he doesn't love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back.",,,
361,Is there any hope?,,,
362,"A year ago, the love of my life left me and never looked back.",,,
362,Our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart.,,,
362,I miss her so much and can't seem to get over being so heartbroken.,,,
363,I Googled ¡°chronic lying¡± and found several websites describing what behaviors both he and I have been experiencing.,,,
363,"Both of us agree we have an uncanny, unbreakable bond.",,,
363,"He¡¯s been unfaithful many times, while he remains my only intimate mate.",,,
363,How can I learn to detach from him as he is not going to change?,,,
364,I got married in 2014.,,,
364,I have a two year old son.,,,
364,His mom and I decided to separate due to my infidelities.,,,
364,We've tried to reconcile our differences but it never works out.,,,
364,"Since we've been separated, I've dated someone, and we are expecting a baby girl.",,,
364,Is this something I should mention to my wife?,,,
364,"The current woman whom I'm dating has been telling me for months to break up with her, but it's hard because I actually love her.",,,
365,"I got engaged, and everything was going well.",,,
365,"Things went downhill at some point, and I broke off the engagement due to an opportunity to go to college.",,,
365,"After that, I found out she had been cheating on me.",,,
365,"I think about her all the time now, and we have been communicating on and off, but my friends/family don't know.",,,
366,"He was in love with someone years ago, and he still thinks about her time to time.",,,
366,"He said, and I quote, ""That relationship is definitely over.",,,
366,"I love you, but that girl will always be in my mind.""",,,
366,It just didn't feel like he appreciated all the things I've done to make him happy.,,,
367,My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago.,,,
367,Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house.,,,
367,"He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce.",,,
367,What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male.,,,
367,Why does he constantly do these behaviors?,,,
367,I might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist.,,,
368,My husband and I are separated.,,,
368,He says he needs some time apart.,,,
368,He says he needs to get back the ¡°in love¡± part of a relationship but doesn¡¯t want to lose me.,,,
368,Should I wait or start over new?,,,
369,I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.,,,
369,I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship.,,,
369,I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling.,,,
369,I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.,,,
369,I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself.,,,
369,I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive.,,,
369,I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change.,,,
369,How do I stop this behavior and thought process?,,,
370,"After my fianc¨¦ cheated on me because of a miscommunication, I pulled myself away from him.",,,
370,Now he says all he wants is be with me.,,,
370,I'm pushing him away mentally now because he cheated on me again.,,,
370,I make plans with him that I don't keep.,,,
370,I really do love him still and I care about him.,,,
370,Should I give home one more chance?,,,
371,I recently went through a divorce.,,,
371,My ex-husband called my sister saying bad things about me.,,,
371,My sister never defended me.,,,
371,"Now that I showed the truth, she's shutting me up and saying she doesn't care about the fight.",,,
371,Why didn't she convey that to him from the beginning?,,,
372,"She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later.",,,
372,"I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.",,,
373,My ex-girlfriend says she's bored and wants to experience life single.,,,
373,"I treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didn't do anything, I feel remorseful, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get her back.",,,
373,She's unhappy.,,,
373,"When I called her, she was crying and said she will text me when she's ready.",,,
374,My fianc¨¦ and I broke up.,,,
374,He cheated on me numerous times.,,,
374,I kept forgiving but questioning his every move.,,,

375,I was in a relationship with a woman for four years.,,,
375,"We both made mistakes, but I do love her.",,,
375,She has moved in with another lady.,,,
375,I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her.,,,
375,How can I find out for sure?,,,
376,My ex-fianc¨¦ (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters.,,,
376,They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years).,,,
376,"He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids.",,,
376,He is "co-existing" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend.,,,
376,His daughters don¡¯t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs.,,,
376,His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me.,,,
376,He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels.,,,
376,He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to "do the right thing" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids.,,,
376,He says he wants me to wait.,,,
376,We were going get married last year.,,,
376,"He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me.",,,
376,He says he¡¯s trying to mend his relationship with them.,,,
379,Ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years.,,,
379,"Even though I care about him, he continues to hurt me.",,,
379,He and his wife were separated when we met.,,,
379,Now he's going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard.,,,
379,"I want to end this relationship, but I don't feel like I can.",,,
379,How can I let go?,,,
380,I was in a relationship for almost five years.,,,
380,We were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship.,,,
380,"He was a caring, friendly, and charming guy up until three and a half years in.",,,
380,"He started controlling me: who I hung out with, where I was at all times, and he had a huge hissy fit if I tried to ask him the same questions.",,,
380,"All that time, he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my so-called friends.",,,
380,"At the end, he was a nasty and narcissistic person.",,,
380,Now it¡¯s hard to be social.,,,
381,"We're not together, but I¡¯m still doing things for him and we are intimate.",,,
381,He¡¯s not there for his son.,,,
382,My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me.,,,
382,"He's been talking about divorce, but he hasn't filed.",,,

446,"I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children.",,,
446,We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly.,,,
446,"He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change.",,,
446,Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay.,,,
446,"I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me.",,,
446,I know he has to change that on his own.,,,
446,I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned?,,,
446,Is there hope for a better future together?,,,
447,I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I¡¯ve never dealt with my emotions.,,,
447,My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year.,,,
447,My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes.,,,
447,"I love her, and I think I¡¯m about to lose her, if I already haven¡¯t.",,,
447,"I throw things at her when I¡¯m angry, and sometimes I hit her.",,,
447,"I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her.",,,
447,"I don¡¯t want to lose her, and I don¡¯t want the situation to worsen.",,,
447,"I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood.",,,
447,I'm ready to change.,,,
447,I need help now.,,,
447,I'm about to explode.,,,
448,I've been with my boyfriend over 3 years.,,,
448,He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant.,,,
448,He is physically and mentally abusive towards me.,,,
448,"I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything.",,,
448,I¡¯m always there when he needs my help.,,,
448,He tells me although I help him doesn¡¯t mean that I am a good person.,,,
448,He always discredits me as a woman and it¡¯s hurtful.,,,
448,I spend most day crying and feeling lonely.,,,
448,I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.,,,
449,I have a child with my baby mother.,,,
449,She works I take care of our young son.,,,
449,"She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting me down, telling me to get out and telling me she doesn't love me, but then the next day after our fight she says she does.",,,
449,I'm having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops.,,,
449,Now me and my family don't talk.,,,
449,She's always telling me I'm annoying and just belittles me.,,,
449,Nothing I do is right.,,,
449,She says I work you watch the baby.,,,
449,On her days off she never cooks or cleans.,,,
449,"I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says he's not any thing to her.",,,
449,What do I do?,,,
449,I don't want to leave.,,,
450,I¡¯ve known my boyfriend for several years.,,,
450,We were friends for a long time.,,,
450,"In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state.",,,
450,I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job.,,,
450,"However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time.",,,
450,We decided later to make it work.,,,
450,"Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant.",,,
450,I wanted to tell him during his next visit.,,,
450,"However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money.",,,
450,"After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts.",,,
450,"Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage.",,,
450,"I texted him about what had happened, and he didn¡¯t seem to care.",,,
450,I was extremely hurt by this.,,,
450,I still decided to move back as I had originally planned.,,,
450,He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him.,,,
450,"During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know.",,,
450,"Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him.",,,
450,"He never got a job, which was in the original plan.",,,
450,"After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together.",,,
450,"Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in.",,,
450,I thought he had too.,,,
450,But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman.,,,
450,"In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her.",,,
450,"When I confronted him about this, he wasn¡¯t apologetic.",,,
450,He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone.,,,
450,He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car.,,,
450,I don¡¯t know what to do.,,,
451,Now I have anger and trust issues.,,,
451,How can I treat this and fix myself?,,,
452,"When I got home, my boyfriend and I got into an argument.",,,
452,He got upset and he started hitting his face.,,,
452,"That is the first time he has ever done that, but I would be lying if I said that didn't scare me.",,,
452,I locked myself in the room.,,,
453,My roommate is a unapologetic person who doesn't care who she hurts.,,,
453,She never apologizes to me or my family.,,,
453,She made me lose my temper today to the point where I was using swear words in front of my mom and brother.,,,
454,"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.",,,
454,I even start throwing things.,,,
454,Do I have a problem?,,,
455,"When I think of things people put me through in the past, I get upset all over again and take it out on everyone.",,,
455,I'll be mad for nothing at all and have a attitude with everyone for no reason.,,,
456,I get really mad easily at my parents and family.,,,
457,I snap easy and push people away.,,,
457,I need help before I push my boyfriend away.,,,
458,I get angry and act out.,,,
458,It scares my wife and child.,,,
459,We're in an eight year relationship.,,,
459,My boyfriend drinks a lot.,,,
459,He experienced childhood trauma.,,,
459,I don't know how to deal with violent outbursts.,,,
460,"Any time things get heated, the past gets brought up.",,,
460,I raise my voice at her to try to get a point across.,,,
460,She asks open-ended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me.,,,
460,She's seven months pregnant.,,,
460,"I have drank in the past, but I'm not dependent on alcohol¡ªI only drink at social events.",,,
461,Everything just makes me upset.,,,
462,My long-term girlfriend broke up with me recently.,,,
462,She says it's because of my anger.,,,
463,My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams.,,,
463,"Not violent like he's hurting someone, but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones.",,,
463,He explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening.,,,
463,"It was far beyond anything in a horror movie, he says he can't help these thoughts they just pop up.",,,
463,Please help!,,,
464,I been having anger problems a lot lately.,,,
464,It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off.,,,
464,I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband.,,,
464,I think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot.,,,
464,"I don't get nearly as bad as he does, but I yell almost constantly and I can't seem to just stop.",,,
464,"I have two young babies that have to hear this, and I don't want my girls growing up with a mommy like I have been lately.",,,
464,I just don't know how to get back to my old self.,,,
465,I have not been able to really sleep.,,,
465,I stay up all times of the night not even knowing why.,,,
465,"Every day, I feel like I have anger inside of me.",,,
465,"I have a little family, but I can't open up to them like I want to.",,,
465,"I have a son, and I feel that I take my anger out on him by screaming at him.",,,
466,My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself.,,,
466,My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor.,,,
466,"It causes violent thoughts, but I never act.",,,
466,"I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent, not me.",,,
466,I don't want to drown myself in anger and resentment.,,,
467,"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting.",,,
467,I say mean things to let my anger out.,,,
467,Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend.,,,
467,I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality.,,,
467,I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful.,,,
467,I hurt the ones I love with my words.,,,
467,I want to be better for myself and them.,,,
468,I don't know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger.,,,
468,That's really the only one i feel.,,,
469,The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches¡ªmostly mouth breathing and snoring.,,,
469,"It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.",,,
470,"I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges.",,,
470,I am angry all the time.,,,
470,I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was.,,,
470,I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine.,,,
470,I have these urges to hurt someone really bad.,,,
470,I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting.,,,
470,I want to hear their agonizing pained-filled voices.,,,
470,What is wrong with me?,,,
471,I have a really bad temper.,,,
471,I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day.,,,
471,"I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.",,,
472,I am so angry.,,,
472,"I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't know what to do.",,,

473,I don't know what's with me.,,,
473,I'm almost constantly angry.,,,
473,"Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me.",,,
473,"When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over.",,,
473,I get angry at the littlest things.,,,
473,"Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me.",,,
473,Something perfectly normal can make me go off.,,,
473,"When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while.",,,
473,"It's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.",,,
475,"When I see something I don¡¯t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb.",,,
475,I go from ¡°0 to 100¡± really quickly.,,,
476,"Every time I speak, he says I anger him.",,,
476,"Also, when he¡¯s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me.",,,
476,I feel like we¡¯re so distant from each other now.,,,
476,"We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in.",,,
476,What should I do?,,,
476,We've been married for two years but together for seven.,,,
477,I'm a teenager.,,,
477,"I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage.",,,
477,"I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too.",,,
477,I get self-destructive.,,,
477,I used to cut but stopped.,,,
477,"Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs.",,,
477,"Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom.",,,
477,I don't live in a bad household.,,,
477,"I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job.",,,
477,I have no idea what this is and I don't know how to control it.,,,
477,It's over any little thing.,,,
477,"Tonight, it was because I couldn't get my earrings out.",,,
477,"This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it's always over stupid, petty things.",,,
479,I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,,,
480,I have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month.,,,
481,I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two.,,,
481,"It usually happens in bed at night, but I occasionally experience this during the day.",,,
481,"I have a benign brain tumor, but the doctor said it is not associated with this.",,,
482,"I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic.",,,
482,I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out.,,,
482,"He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not.",,,
482,I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes.,,,
482,"I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired.",,,
482,"I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.",,,
483,It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I¡¯d estimate about two hours.,,,
483,"I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.",,,
483,I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years.,,,
483,"Also, my father¡¯s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition.",,,
483,"I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.",,,
483,"After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved.",,,
483,"However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning.",,,
483,How can I solve this issue?,,,
484,Sometimes 3 times a night.,,,
485,My spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in Amsterdam.,,,
485,After he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds.,,,
485,"In the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened, from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute.",,,
485,How do I know if he had sex?,,,
486,My husband and I had our first threesome recently.,,,
486,Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.,,,
486,"He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it.",,,
486,But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling.,,,
486,Why am I feeling this way?,,,
487,My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this).,,,
487,"A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed.",,,
487,I caught him one night drinking behind my back.,,,
487,"I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing.",,,
487,He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again.,,,
487,"Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night.",,,
487,I didn't like this.,,,
487,"For our New Year¡¯s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption.",,,
487,He was on board¡ªno more drinking every night.,,,
487,"The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing.",,,
487,"It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka.",,,
487,"He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait).",,,
487,"I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep¡ªit's a dead giveaway he's been drinking).",,,
487,He slurred a bit and said no.,,,
487,"I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no.",,,
487,"I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.",,,
487,I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not.,,,
487,"I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty.",,,
487,He is a good husband in every other regard.,,,
488,I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14.,,,
488,Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,,,
489,I love my girlfriend so much.,,,
489,I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her.,,,
489,But the two times we tried to have sex I couldn't get an erection.,,,
489,We've only had sex once and it was a long time ago.,,,
489,Why this is happening and what can I do about it?,,,
490,For some reason I feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media.,,,
490,"I know she is proud of her body and I respect that, but I dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does.",,,
490,Anytime I bring it up to her she thinks Im calling her a whore.,,,
490,How can I deal with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media and not hurt her feelings?,,,
491,My fianc¨¦ and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good.,,,
491,The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasn't getting enough sexual attention from me.,,,
491,I recently found out he cheated on me with another women.,,,
491,He says he wants his family back but I'm confused on what to do.,,,
491,"Is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should I just move on?",,,
492,"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away.",,,
492,"Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away.",,,
492,I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive.,,,
492,I love him so much.,,,
492,Why do I do this?,,,
493,"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.",,,
493,How can I approach them about it?,,,
493,"should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.",,,
493,I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.,,,
493,What should I do?,,,
494,I'm feeling rejected and frustrated.,,,
494,This is not new.,,,
494,"The first month we were together, sex was about every day.",,,
494,Then it slowed down to once a month right away.,,,
494,"I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.",,,
495,I have been married for 11 years.,,,
495,Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart.,,,
495,We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other.,,,
495,I often feel that my husband has "friends" at work that he is more emotional invested in than me.,,,
495,I feel very alone and just uncared for.,,,
495,Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected?,,,
496,My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives.,,,
496,"We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex.",,,
496,She doesn't have the desire.,,,
496,She's also never orgasmed.,,,
496,She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her.,,,
496,She doesn't know why.,,,
496,"Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried.",,,
496,"However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop.",,,
496,That makes me feel really awful.,,,
496,We rarely have foreplay.,,,
496,"Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop.",,,
496,We are both frustrated but very much in love.,,,
496,She and I are in our early 20s.,,,
496,We¡¯re married and we have a baby on the way.,,,
497,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times.",,,
497,Others have told me that most men would have left me by now.,,,
497,"Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing.",,,
497,I want to be better connected with my husband.,,,
498,My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years.,,,
498,I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't.,,,
498,"I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails.",,,
498,"I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case.",,,
498,How do I stop this?,,,
498,It's driving a wedge between us.,,,
500,"I¡¯m always questioning her about things such as who she is texting and talking to on the phone, why she is always on social media, checking her phone records, and going through her phone.",,,
500,"I do this knowing that I have never found any reason for her to be cheating, and I have no reason to.",,,
501,"So many people lie, and it's hard to tell who speaks the truth.",,,
501,Who do I trust?,,,
501,I don't even trust my family or friends.,,,
502,Nothing we've tried has worked so far.,,,
503,"Today, my boyfriend broke up with me because he says I stress him out with me not trusting him and always accusing him of things.",,,
503,It hit me that I still hold on to every bad thing my mother has ever said to me and everything that anyone has ever done to me.,,,
503,I act as if he's going to do it too.,,,
504,I have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times.,,,
504,I pretend we aren't married at my work.,,,
504,"Recently, he has caught on, but I lie to cover it.",,,
504,"He use to talk to girls online, but I have caught myself constantly having a affair.",,,
505,"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.",,,
506,We can't hold a conversation together.,,,
506,The blame is always pointed at me.,,,
506,We have no intimacy.,,,
507,"My spouse seems to get very bothered by me speaking, asking questions, or getting excited in a way that he thinks is ""too much.""",,,
507,"He comes across as acting like whatever it is I'm talking about is nowhere near as important as whatever he's thinking about, which he believes will go over my head.",,,
508,He leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me.,,,
508,He gets defensive when I ask him stuff.,,,
508,We haven't had sex in two months.,,,
508,"He says it's because he's not working, I'm pregnant, he doesn't like it here, and he hasn't been on the mood lately.",,,
509,"After receiving counseling, we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder.",,,
509,"When I offer compromises in our disagreements, he does not seem to understand.",,,
509,We cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white.,,,
509,My husband has asked that we go to counseling this time.,,,
509,"In the past, it has been my suggestion.",,,
509,We are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved.,,,
509,He cannot see the whole picture when I attempt to explain my side to him.,,,
510,I have been married for ten years.,,,
510,My husband is 29 years my senior.,,,
510,We have a young daughter.,,,
510,"Ever since she was born, my husband has ""shut down.""",,,
510,We have no intimacy; he doesn't even kiss me.,,,
510,"I've told him how I feel for years, and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy, but I still have to literally beg for sex and affection.",,,
510,"My self-esteem is gone, and I feel so alone.",,,
510,He has stranded me.,,,
510,He uses his passive-aggressive ways and ignores every comment I make.,,,
510,He refuses to talk to me in detail.,,,
511,"With college over, my boyfriend and I have such different work schedules.",,,
511,"Since I can't see him often, I want to talk more on the phone.",,,
511,"He plays video games while talking to players, so often I feel ignored.",,,
511,"I find myself always telling him what to do in relation to me, things he should know.",,,
512,"I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone.",,,
512,It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend.,,,
512,"Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again.",,,
512,I really want some help.,,,
513,"I was with my friends at the park, and we were talking and having fun.",,,
513,"After a while, I met a girl there.",,,
513,"We talked and flirted for a while, then we gave our numbers to each other and left.",,,
513,"We talked for a few months, then we met up again.",,,
513,"She kissed me, so I assumed we were dating.",,,
513,Then I found out she has a boyfriend.,,,
514,He's gone for 11 weeks for a band camp.,,,
514,It's week two right now.,,,
514,"We used to be Intimate a lot, and now since he's busy 12 hours a day, we can't really be Intimate, even over the phone.",,,
514,Is it normal for me to more sensitive in general?,,,
515,My husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in November.,,,
515,"She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter.",,,
515,I wasn¡¯t aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was.,,,
515,"He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night.",,,
515,"The next morning, we talked about going to counseling.",,,
515,He went out that night with friends and said his ex-wife wasn't going.,,,
515,I found out in April that she did go.,,,
515,I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open.,,,
515,I found out that he stayed that second night with her.,,,
515,"I asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights.",,,
515,His daughter wasn't there the second night.,,,
515,"He claims they didn't have sex, but what else should I think?",,,
516,She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family.,,,
516,We don't talk much because of it.,,,
516,"Also, we have little fights.",,,
516,We want to work it out but we don't know how.,,,
517,I went to my ex-boyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends who's attempted to commit suicide.,,,
517,"When I went to him to reach out to his high school friend, he told me that I put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders.",,,
517,He was very angry that I went to him to do that.,,,
517,Am I in the wrong for going to him to reach out?,,,
517,"He helped me so much with my depression and bad habits, so that's why I thought of him to reach out.",,,
517,He made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help.,,,
517,Why did he react this way towards me?,,,
517,I think he's being selfish.,,,
518,He told me he started to back away because I was asking for too much in the relationship.,,,
518,"The more I tried to fix things, the worse it got.",,,
518,"I want to make us better again, but I don't know how.",,,
520,My boyfriend has this close female friend.,,,
520,"It always bothered me because of how close they are, so I decided to meet her.",,,
520,That made the situation worse because they were even closer than what I thought.,,,
520,They acted like a couple rather than friends with each other.,,,
520,"There was no physical interaction, but he talks to this girl a lot.",,,
520,What can I do?,,,
520,Leaving him isn't an option.,,,
522,"I¡¯m a man, and I¡¯m soon to be married.",,,
522,I have been messing around with other men on the side.,,,
522,"It started as a once in a while thing, but it¡¯s been happening a lot.",,,
522,I don't know what to do.,,,
523,She has lied about every aspect of her life.,,,
523,She's created three fake relationships.,,,
523,"The most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos, phone calls, and text messages, and it¡¯s with a married man with kids.",,,
523,Her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives.,,,
524,My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide.,,,
524,"He says that because his dad died, so did his heart.",,,
524,He says that he can't be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again.,,,
524,Why is he doing this when we were very happy together?,,,
524,He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just can't be with me.,,,
525,"Ever since my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, I can't seem to get close to anyone else.",,,
525,"I know I'm completely over him, but I just can't break down my walls and let someone new into my life.",,,
526,"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days.",,,
526,"When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call.",,,
526,"If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful.",,,
526,He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.,,,
527,My husband cheated while I was pregnant with our son with a so-called friend.,,,
527,This was before we were married.,,,
527,We split and eventually worked things out.,,,

528,We always found our way back to each other.,,,
528,He had a baby with someone else he's with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when he's around.,,,
528,"He even gets jealous, but he ignores my calls.",,,
529,"Every day for five years, my husband mentally abused me and said he will change.",,,
529,I have a child with him.,,,
529,"I try so hard to stay strong for her, but at this point, I am completely broken.",,,
529,I am holding on to nothing but hope and have been for years.,,,
529,Is there any hope or am I wasting my time?,,,
530,My boyfriend and I have been disagreeing on a lot lately.,,,
530,It's really coming down to the fact that we want opposite things sometimes.,,,
530,"I do a lot for him: I take care and protect him, and in the end, he still doesn't trust me.",,,
530,"We've both come to the conclusion that when I want something and he doesn't want it, he's not willing to find a happy medium whatsoever.",,,
530,It's just non-negotiable.,,,
530,I'm not sure what to do honestly.,,,
530,He doesn't trust me as much as I wish he did.,,,
530,"Honestly, sometimes I feel like his enemy, and it kills me.",,,

531,"I finally have a great boyfriend who loves me, but I keep pushing him away and I don't want to.",,,
531,I need to learn to open up.,,,
532,I have been dating my boyfriend for eight years.,,,
532,We met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when I met his family who treats him like he is their man.,,,
532,"They expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around, and he thinks it's okay.",,,
533,He's lied about his past/present situations.,,,
533,"Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts.",,,
533,"I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling.",,,
533,"I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.",,,
535,"My fianc¨¦ of 15 years is always helping out his family, and I feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness.",,,
535,"We're about to get married this Saturday, but I feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids.",,,

536,He constantly criticizes me.,,,
537,Someone I care about told me I'm not teachable and I'm irritating.,,,

538,"I've been in a relationship for almost a year, and I absolutely trust my boyfriend.",,,
538,"He treats me nice, checks on me, and tells me sweet things.",,,
538,"However, when it comes to making life decisions, I feel he is very immature.",,,
538,"I try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together, but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting.",,,
538,"As far as dates, if I don't say anything, plan it, or have money to chip in, we will not go.",,,
538,"I feel like I put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling, and all I get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion.",,,
539,My best friend and I've been really close for almost three years.,,,
539,"She lives in the UK, and I live in the US.",,,

545,"Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about.",,,
545,Should I be upset?,,,

547,He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy.,,,
547,He realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why I was allowing him to continue to do that since I was physically paying it for him.,,,
547,"My response was that he was giving me the money, and I just made the payment.",,,
547,I didn't think of the coverages.,,,
547,He was angry about it.,,,
547,I still can't figure out that anger.,,,

550,We don¡¯t go out or do anything with other people because of me.,,,

551,It's really hurtful.,,,
552,My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts.,,,
552,It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow.,,,

553,She works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out.,,,

556,It's just stupid.,,,
557,We've been dating for two months now.,,,
557,I have a heavy past that gets him angry.,,,

571,I fell in love with her in a few months.,,,
571,That was my first love.,,,

571,"I thought she had the same feelings for me, but I was wrong.",,,
571,I always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life.,,,
571,But all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy.,,,
571,"I¡¯ve tried to be in relationship with guys, but I can¡¯t be in love with them.",,,
572,I've been getting told lately by my partner that it¡¯s embarrassing that I'm so antisocial around his family and friends.,,,
572,I believe it's because I'm not as social as him.,,,
573,How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?,,,
574,My partner and I have had an amazing relationship and connection for over two years.,,,
574,We're very committed to each other and are planning a very long life together.,,,
574,"However, he recently was very open and honest that he isn't interested in having sex with me anymore.",,,
574,He says this has happened in every past relationships and has ended it as a result.,,,
574,"He knows it's because it's the ""same person"" feeling, but how can he get over this?",,,

575,"We clicked, or so I thought.",,,
575,We are both married with problems in our marriage.,,,
575,We never have sex; we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together.,,,
575,"His wife found out, and he lied to her and didn't even refer to it as an affair.",,,
575,I can't stop thinking about him.,,,
575,We just click.,,,
575,"I've been married for 16 years, and I've never liked anyone other than my husband.",,,
575,"Now I like him, and we¡¯ll never be together.",,,
576,"My boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me, and I believe it.",,,
576,"It has been one of the best relationships I have been in for a short period of time, but he has lied to me so much.",,,
576,"He¡¯ll tell me that he'll stop lying, and while he¡¯s saying that, he's hiding something or lying about something.",,,
576,"First, it was about a girl.",,,
576,He hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in.,,,
576,Next was his ex-girlfriend.,,,
576,"He put a fake contact name, and it was just friendly, but he lied to my face.",,,
576,"All the time, he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better.",,,
577,"I was texting a guy who wasn't my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out.",,,
577,"We work together, so he went to work and told everyone I was cheating on him.",,,
577,I moved out of the house.,,,
577,"There have been previous problems, and I feel like I'm usually the issue here.",,,
577,"In order for us to move on, he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesn't want me to do anymore.",,,
577,I'm wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if I should walk away.,,,
578,"About a month ago, I went through my boyfriend¡¯s phone and found him messaging his ex-girlfriend that he was dating before me.",,,
578,"He gave her a promise ring when they were together, and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our son¡¯s room.",,,
578,"I found many things on his phone, but that broke my heart the most.",,,
578,He deleted all the messages but two.,,,
578,I can't help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that.,,,
578,"It really kills me, and I can't stop thinking about it.",,,
579,I have been married for 20 years.,,,
579,He and I both cheated.,,,
579,I hid my cheating for 14 years.,,,
579,"Over that time, I let life stress me out.",,,
579,I became depressed.,,,
579,"When I finally woke up, he felt I had pushed him out.",,,
580,My boyfriend recently got a kitty.,,,
580,"I hate cats in general, and he knows it.",,,
580,It grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat.,,,
580,I want to throw out the cat.,,,
580,I feel very jealous.,,,
581,"Over the course of a few days, my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues.",,,
581,"After she thought things through, she came to the realization that she is no longer ""in love"" or attracted romantically to me.",,,
581,She instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just "family.",,,
581,"At that point, she said our marriage was over.",,,
581,"Now over the course of the last few days, she has taken a ""friendship"" from a coworker.",,,
581,"She insists there is nothing more than friends, but she has spent all her free time with him.",,,
583,I have no idea what happened.,,,
583,I go places and do things but still feel lonely.,,,
583,"I honestly have no friends, and I am always the one texting people and bothering people.",,,
583,"I feel invisible, like someone that no one wants to be around.",,,
584,"I love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex, but when it comes to the actual penetration, I hate it.",,,
584,"I don't know why, but I just want it to be over.",,,
584,I feel like crying.,,,
584,I don't know why I don¡¯t like it because all of my friends enjoy it.,,,
585,I didn't trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling.,,,
585,I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on.,,,
585,Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust.,,,
586,I've been in a relationship for over a year.,,,
586,He's cheated and lied.,,,
586,"I heard he's married, but he says he's not.",,,
586,Everything is very up and down; there's no trust.,,,
586,"Recently, he went on a trip, and I promised him I'd behave and not drink because when I drink, I drink too much, and I tend to make poor choices.",,,
586,"This time, I made a huge mistake: I drank too much, and I cheated on him.",,,
586,I slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what I was doing is wrong.,,,
586,I told him and he just got really rude.,,,
586,He called me names and threatened me.,,,
586,I feel bad as I do love him.,,,
586,We just have so many issues.,,,
586,"I'm not a bad person, I've just made a lot of bad mistakes.",,,
586,"It¡¯s unintentional, and I know right from wrong, but why do I still make the wrong choice?",,,
587,"I crave attention, companionship, and sex.",,,
587,"She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.",,,
588,I've been with my husband for eight years now.,,,
588,"We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated.",,,
588,"I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes.",,,
588,"However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust.",,,
588,"My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.",,,
588,"During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.",,,
588,But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child.,,,
588,"The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.",,,
588,"He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).",,,
588,He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.,,,
588,"He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.",,,

588,He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time.,,,
588,"He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him.",,,
588,He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.,,,
588,I'm of course hurt and in shock.,,,
588,I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away.,,,

595,"We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido.",,,

595,Our sex life has suffered as a result.,,,
595,"Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal.",,,
595,"Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered.",,,
595,"I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it.",,,
595,She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking.,,,
595,I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation.,,,
595,I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further.,,,

600,I¡¯ve since told him that I wanted to work things out but he¡¯s not sure I actually mean it.,,,

675,"I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship.",,,
675,What can I do?,,,
676,I use to be so happy.,,,
676,"No matter what, I always was happy.",,,
676,I got into a relationship with this guy.,,,
676,I love him so much.,,,
676,We¡¯re both teenagers.,,,
676,"The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him.",,,
676,It broke me.,,,
676,"He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other.",,,
676,He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.,,,
677,I'm applying to private high schools.,,,
677,"I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it.",,,
677,"I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started.",,,
677,"However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither.",,,
677,I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team.,,,
677,"I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school.",,,
677,Now I don't know what to do!,,,
677,My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play.,,,
677,I just want to run away.,,,
678,I am always arguing with my father.,,,
678,He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling.,,,
678,I get upset often at this.,,,
678,Am I too sensitive?,,,
678,He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings.,,,
678,"No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.",,,
679,I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life.,,,
679,I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend.,,,
679,"I am now married, and my husband¡¯s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend.",,,
679,They also have a daughter together.,,,
679,My issue is that there is always drama.,,,
679,"I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments.",,,
679,"I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed.",,,
679,"However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter.",,,
679,I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter.,,,
679,That led to an argument.,,,
679,I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter.,,,
679,My stepdaughter¡¯s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend.,,,
679,I especially told him I didn't want to be involved.,,,
679,"Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on.",,,
679,He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn¡¯t discuss my stepdaughter¡¯s matters with him.,,,
679,The point is there is so much drama.,,,
679,I try my best to get along with everyone.,,,
679,I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question).,,,
679,"I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone¡¯s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting.",,,
679,"I had a party planned for my daughter¡¯s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn¡¯t let me have her.",,,
679,"In my eyes, it¡¯s the child that is hurting.",,,
679,"I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.",,,
680,She treats me like I'm not in her presence.,,,
680,She¡¯s always yelling at me for no reason.,,,
680,"She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.",,,
681,I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home.,,,
681,"They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house.",,,
681,Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way?,,,
681,This is not a joke.,,,
681,I am trying to understand.,,,
682,I am married to a beautiful lady.,,,
682,I love my wife with all my heart.,,,
682,We have 3 boys and I have a daughter from a previous marriage.,,,
682,We also have 3 grandchildren.,,,
682,Now this event is tearing us apart.,,,
682,I want our family to be together and happy.,,,
682,It was a mistake from so long ago.,,,
682,My wife wants to leave and I don't want that to happen I love her so much.,,,
682,Please help me save my marriage.,,,
682,Even my 3 boys want us to work it out.,,,
682,They love us both and want our family together.,,,
682,Please give me some advice or hope.,,,
682,Sincerely heart broken.,,,
683,I started dating a guy I met online.,,,
683,He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything.,,,
683,He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years.,,,
683,That was more than two decades ago.,,,
683,Nothing on his record since.,,,
683,I always believe the past should be left in past.,,,
683,"But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving.",,,
683,Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him?,,,
683,If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.,,,
685,I'm having issues with my relative.,,,
685,The police never believe the experiences I have been through because I am only a kid.,,,
685,I've even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me.,,,
685,Could you please give me advice?,,,
686,The last of my emotions belong to my pets.,,,
686,Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow.,,,
686,If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says "here lays my emotions.,,,
686,R.I.P.",,,
686,I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my family's.,,,
686,What's wrong with me?,,,
687,"I have secrets in my mind, and I don't know what to do with them.",,,
687,I don't want to tell my wife and mom because I don't want to hurt them.,,,
687,But I'm not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself.,,,
687,What should I do?,,,
687,It's becoming annoying and making me anxious.,,,
687,Help me out,,,
688,"I'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me.",,,
688,How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?,,,
689,He wants to wear makeup and heels.,,,
689,He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina.,,,
689,He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him.,,,
689,"I have tried this for him, but I don¡¯t like it and have told him so.",,,
689,He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.,,,
690,I'm feeling different towards my husband.,,,
690,I feel I am growing from the relationship.,,,
690,I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five.,,,
690,I just don't feel that connection anymore.,,,
690,I feel nothing.,,,
690,I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.,,,
691,I have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man.,,,
691,"I talked to her about it, and she said she will do it for me.",,,
691,"The idea excites me to no end, but I don¡¯t want to because it disgusts me.",,,
691,"How can I stop wanting it, or should I just give into it and do it?",,,
691,I¡¯ve been struggling for years with this.,,,
691,It won¡¯t go away.,,,
691,"By the way, I am in my mid 30s and my wife is in her mid 40s.",,,
692,My husband doesn¡¯t trust me for some past we had.,,,
692,"I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not.",,,
693,What makes a healthy marriage last?,,,
694,That phrase makes me crazy.,,,
694,"It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change, such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie.",,,
694,"Another example is when he opens the front door, the dog runs out if he doesn't pick him up.",,,
694,"Over and over again, he lets the dog run out, and I am afraid he will get hit by a car.",,,
695,All we do is argue.,,,
695,We never agree on anything.,,,
696,I found out today that my wife is cheating on me.,,,
696,"I love her, but she won¡¯t tell the truth even when I have proof.",,,
696,"When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.",,,
697,I've only been married three months.,,,
697,"Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.",,,
698,"If I tell him I don't like certain things, he does when it pertains to me.",,,
698,He tells me it's not like that.,,,
698,He never has anything to say about me until I tell him something about himself.,,,
699,Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family.,,,
699,"However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened.",,,
699,I feel like I cannot trust him.,,,
699,"Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship.",,,
699,"On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt.",,,
699,I'm not sure how to move forward?,,,
700,"I love him, but he doesn¡¯t show me love.",,,
700,He talks badly about me to his friends.,,,
701,My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia.,,,
701,I have been dealing with that all day.,,,
701,My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said.,,,
702,My husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person.,,,
702,"Before, he worked and slept, and on off days, he'd stay home because he didn't want to do anything else.",,,
702,Now he's going out with friends several nights a week while I'm still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself.,,,
702,"He's suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, I'm remembering how I've been emotionally starving for the last five years.",,,
703,I decided to stay and work it out.,,,
703,I just don¡¯t want to sit on the couch.,,,
703,"Other than that, I have been getting over the situation.",,,
703,I don't feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and won¡¯t leave me alone about it.,,,
703,"I can move on and continue to love, laugh, and play with my wife.",,,
703,I just don't want to sit on that couch.,,,
704,My husband and I have been together since high school.,,,
704,"We have been married going on for nearly ten years, and we have three beautiful children.",,,
704,"A few weeks ago, my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dad¡¯s for a while.",,,
704,He comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong.,,,
704,Can this marriage be saved or is it too late?,,,
704,"He said he would go to counseling, so I don't think he has given up.",,,
705,My husband and I would've been married for five years come June 2016.,,,
705,Our infant daughter just had her birthday.,,,
705,"Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce.",,,
705,"He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife.",,,
705,He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant.,,,
705,The children do not have a good relationship with him now.,,,
705,He has another child from a woman he was dating.,,,
705,He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.,,,
705,It seems to me that there is a pattern.,,,
705,He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older.,,,
705,"I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers.",,,
705,He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder.,,,
705,He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals.,,,
705,Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have?,,,
705,Where do you recommend researching this?,,,
706,My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad.,,,
706,It was a time when my health was poor.,,,
706,I'm have a hard time moving on.,,,
707,I have been with my husband for almost 7 years.,,,
707,We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together.,,,
707,I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose.,,,
707,When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned.,,,
707,I was happy but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too.,,,
707,I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family.,,,
707,I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldn't help how I was feeling.,,,
707,We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds.,,,
707,I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted.,,,
707,I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding.,,,
707,What I wanted will never happen.,,,
707,I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it.,,,
707,I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset.,,,
707,I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just can't control it.,,,
707,It's ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it.,,,
707,"Plus, I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed.",,,
707,Why can't I move on?,,,
709,I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,,,
710,I have been obsessed with food and my weight so much that it consumes my daily activities.,,,
710,I weigh myself 2-3 times a day and cut down on my food intake.,,,
711,I've been bulimic for about 6 years now.,,,
711,I'm in my early 20s.,,,
711,"I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.",,,
711,I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge.,,,
711,Over and over.,,,
711,Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?,,,
712,"I have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress.",,,
712,I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off.,,,
712,"I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager.",,,
712,Are there any coping mechanisms I can use to break this cycle?,,,
714,I have no self control over food.,,,
714,"Most people stop when they've had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it.",,,
714,Especially with sweets - I'm never done eating dessert.,,,
715,We've been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years.,,,
715,I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker.,,,
715,I don't know how to approach this situation.,,,
715,How do I ask him about it?.,,,
717,I¡¯ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year.,,,
717,This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy.,,,
717,She says it¡¯s ¡°just a crush¡± but I don't know how to cope with it.,,,
717,How should I deal with this?,,,
718,My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years.,,,
718,I've been really sad lately and for the past few months I've realized I'm just way too dependent on him.,,,
718,"It makes me really upset to be so dependent on someone else, but I can't help it.",,,
718,I don't even know who I am without him.,,,
718,How can I be less dependent on my him?,,,
719,I've been with a man for four years.,,,
719,"For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else.",,,
719,His words do not match his actions.,,,
719,"I love this man, but it's hurting so much.",,,
720,I feel so alone.,,,
720,"I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand.",,,
720,"They say it will all be okay, or they don't listen to me st all.",,,
720,Everyone says they are here for me but it doesn't feel like they are.,,,
720,Why do I feel so alone?,,,
721,I don't know how to tell someone how I feel about them.,,,
721,How can I get better at expressing how I feel?,,,
722,We weren't long distance until he joined the military.,,,
722,"I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated.",,,
722,"He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid.",,,
722,How do I keep our relationship going?,,,
723,"I have high functioning autism and I have been on a lot of dating sites like meet me, match, and zoosk.",,,
723,I haven't had any luck on any of the dating sites I have been on.,,,
723,I really want a boyfriend but I don't know what I should do.,,,
723,I just want to be in a relationship.,,,
723,How can I meet someone?,,,
724,Over a year ago I had a female friend.,,,
724,She turned out to be kind of crazy so I decided to stop talking to her.,,,
724,When she would call me I wouldn't answer the phone.,,,
724,This made my girlfriend really suspicious.,,,
724,She would ask me why I wouldn't ever answer that phone number.,,,
724,"I told my girlfriend that I don't want to be friends with that other woman, but I don't think she believes me.",,,
724,How can I get my girlfriend to understand?,,,
725,"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be.",,,
725,"Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men.",,,
725,"The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again.",,,
725,"However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust.",,,
725,Am I asking for too much in the "perfect guy"?,,,
725,Is there such a thing?,,,
725,Am I truly in love?,,,
726,I've been with my partner for 4 years.,,,
726,She's given me no reason not to trust her.,,,
726,But lately I've been overreacting a lot when she's just doing normal things.,,,
726,I think it's triggering my bad past relationships.,,,
726,How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?,,,
727,"However, it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself.",,,
727,I have even accused him of having a secret phone.,,,
727,"Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose, or is he really talking to himself?",,,
728,I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with.,,,
728,It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.,,,
728,I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend.,,,
728,Was i wrong?,,,
729,I'm dating a guy I really love.,,,
729,"We have our problems, but I could see myself with him long term.",,,
729,But there's this other guy who I've had feelings for for awhile now.,,,
729,"He gives me butterflies when we talk, and my heart beats fast when I see he's texted me, which i never felt with my current boyfriend.",,,
730,My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now.,,,
730,"He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids.",,,
730,He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors.,,,
730,"He lies and cheats, but I love him.",,,
730,"I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.",,,
731,I have been holding myself for nearly a month.,,,
731,I can not bear it.,,,
731,"He is isolated from everybody, and I want to help, but I cannot find him.",,,
732,I'm in a relationship with my fianc¨¦ and I currently found out that she's been cheating on me with a co-worker.,,,
732,I was very upset none the less.,,,
732,"I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her.",,,
732,So I'm willing to forgive and move on.,,,
732,"We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son.",,,
732,"At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating.",,,
732,She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful.,,,
732,I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling.,,,
732,All I can think about is her with another man.,,,
732,I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?,,,
733,I met the first man five months ago.,,,
733,I have come a long way and do have feelings for him.,,,
733,I know he would do anything for me and my kids.,,,
733,"The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him.",,,
733,"I know they both love me, and I love both of them.",,,
734,I have had a crush on this guy for years.,,,
734,I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school.,,,
734,We left off on a good note.,,,
734,"Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?",,,
735,There's this boy who asked me out awhile ago.,,,
735,I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me.,,,
735,How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends?,,,
736,"We have been together for a little bit, and I love him to death, but my mental health is so unstable.",,,
736,I question everything he does from loving me to if my body is good enough.,,,
736,"I'm super jealous for no reason, and my temper is super short.",,,
736,He's pretty much done.,,,
736,He said I have a bit more than a week to fix it.,,,
737,"About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site.",,,
737,"We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date.",,,
737,"We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex.",,,
737,"After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks.",,,
737,"Then one day, she went to her family¡¯s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed.",,,
737,"Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast.",,,
737,We had finally found each other.,,,
737,"We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love.",,,
737,"A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently.",,,
737,I was very hurt and didn¡¯t understand.,,,
737,"Then another week later, she told me she couldn¡¯t do it at all anymore.",,,
737,I was crushed!,,,
737,"A few days later, she tells me how much she¡¯s missing me and ¡°let¡¯s get together for lunch¡± or something like that.",,,
737,"Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her.",,,
737,"So for her child¡¯s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen.",,,
737,"She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child.",,,
737,"Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused.",,,
737,She doesn¡¯t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly.,,,
737,"I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself.",,,
737,"We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn¡¯t work out for her, we will try again.",,,
737,"I¡¯m completely in love with her, and I¡¯m in extreme pain.",,,
738,I have suffered many things at home and school.,,,
738,"We never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that, but I always feel like a part of my heart is missing.",,,
738,"I try to fill it in with objects or, in this case, a woman.",,,
739,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her.,,,
739,How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,,,
740,Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language.,,,
740,But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish.,,,
740,He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup.,,,
740,"I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it.",,,
740,It's like I'm battling myself.,,,
740,What do you feel?,,,
741,I told him I liked him.,,,
741,He called me lovely and pretty but he said he didn¡¯t want a relationship.,,,
741,He would always flirt with me.,,,
742,I met this girl in high school.,,,
742,"She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since.",,,
742,It's been a few years.,,,
742,"We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common.",,,
742,I never gained the courage to ask her out.,,,
743,My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction.,,,
743,We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant.,,,
743,I don't know what to do to fix the relationship.,,,
744,"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy.",,,
744,"I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out.",,,
744,"Now months later, no man peaks my interest.",,,
744,Am I ready to date again?,,,
744,Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?,,,
745,"My boyfriend is always saying he's done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, he's still here.",,,
745,"He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.",,,
746,I was with my boyfriend for years on and off.,,,
746,We dated and broke up three times.,,,
746,Since we broke up five months ago I can't move on.,,,
746,I want to get back together but he won't talk to me.,,,
746,What should I do?,,,
747,"I really like this guy and I think he likes me back, but his sister is my bestfriend.",,,
747,I'm afraid that if I tell her I have a crush on her brother she would loose it.,,,
747,I once told her I thought her brother was cute and she got really angry.,,,
747,I've gotten to know her brother better lately and I've realized he may actually feel the same way.,,,
747,I don't want to lose her friendship.,,,
747,What do I do?,,,
748,I feel like I took our relationship for granted and he's now to the point that he's giving up.,,,
748,I have had trouble feeling like I could trust him but he's given me no reason not to trust him.,,,
748,I know my attitude is also a big issue for him.,,,
748,I have a lot of obligations at home so we don't spend a lot of time together.,,,
748,How can I fix this relationship?,,,
749,"Whenever I sing along with a song that I like (even if it's just for the beat and not the lyrics), my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship.",,,
749,I don't why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song.,,,
749,Now I can't enjoy and sing a song without him thinking I'm trying to give him a hint.,,,
749,He even accuses me of cheating and lying.,,,
749,It's driving me nuts.,,,
749,I love him and would never do such an awful thing ever.,,,
749,How can I get him to understand?,,,
750,"I have a lot of child custody concerns, financial issues, insecurities and weigh gain.",,,
750,I also have no local family support.,,,
750,It's hard for me to stay positive.,,,
750,I get very emotional and take it out on the people I love.,,,
750,How can I stay strong?,,,
751,I was talking to my fiance about changing my hair.,,,
751,He recommended a very specific hair style.,,,
751,Then I found out his ex has that exact same hair.,,,
751,I feel like he must know she has that hair style.,,,
751,"Am I nuts, or does this show that he's still in love with her?",,,
752,My girlfriend recently started hanging out a lot more with one of her friends who did her wrong in the past and just walked out on her.,,,
752,So for the past 3 years its been just me and my girlfriend.,,,
752,Things have been great up until the last month.,,,
752,Now she ignores me and texts and hangs oit with her friend more and more.,,,
752,I dont know what to do anymore.,,,
752,My girlfriend is so distant.,,,
752,How do I keep from losing her?,,,
753,I don't speak up if I'm uncomfortable and hardly ever make plans for us when we hang out.,,,
753,"He is a very open and straightforward person, so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication.",,,
753,We've been together two years and have identified this as our main problem.,,,
753,Arguments have arised from this single issue many times.,,,
754,We¡¯ve been together almost three years.,,,
754,We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn¡¯t love me.,,,
754,"It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry.",,,
754,How can this be resolved?,,,
754,"We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.",,,
755,"I'm dating this guy, Peter.",,,
755,"My friend Jennifer used to date him a while ago, and she's fine with us dating.",,,
755,"My ex-boyfriend, Paul, broke up with Jennifer, and she's devastated about it.",,,
755,Peter and I are going through a rough patch in our relationship.,,,
755,"All of a sudden, Paul is in ""love"" with me, and he wants me back.",,,
755,"I don't know what to do because I can't hurt my friend or my boyfriend, but I think I might Paul again.",,,
756,My boyfriend called me a particular profanity and I broke up with him.,,,
756,This is the third time he's called me this and I'm just completely done with giving him chances.,,,
756,He knows how much it bothers me.,,,
756,I just want to know if I'm over reacting.,,,
757,"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck.",,,
758,"When I ask him who he is talking to, he tells me no one.",,,
758,"But, it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone.",,,
758,I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone.,,,
758,"I ask so much, I feel like I am losing it.",,,
758,"Is he trying to make me question my sanity, or is he talking to himself?",,,
759,"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I can't be happy without him.",,,
759,How do I get away from this relationship?,,,
760,"We had great chemistry, but then he became distant.",,,
760,I had the feeling that I can't be without him.,,,
760,"As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him.",,,
760,"I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.",,,
761,I¡¯m in my early 20s.,,,
761,My ex¡¯s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me.,,,
761,"I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.",,,
762,"I try to do everything right just so we won't argue, and it doesn't help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol.",,,
762,I get anxiety over having fights with him.,,,
763,"Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them.",,,
763,I treated everyone nice.,,,
763,"For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them.",,,
763,"It always ends the same way: ¡°I like you as a friend,¡± or ¡°I love your attention but not you.¡±",,,
764,"I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated.",,,
764,"My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that's lingering in the back of my mind.",,,
765,I blame my past relationship for it.,,,
765,I know it is bad to be this way.,,,
765,I want to get past it.,,,
766,"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc.",,,
766,Nothing seemed to work.,,,
766,My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated.,,,
766,I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men.,,,
766,Is that really okay?,,,
767,i was addicted to porn since the second grade.,,,
767,I'm in my early 40s and overcame my addiction during my separation from my wife of 15 years.,,,
768,"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities.",,,
768,He's working on them and has improved.,,,
768,"We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter.",,,
768,Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.,,,
769,I've been with him for a couple months.,,,
769,We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me.,,,
769,"We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that.",,,
769,"I still wanna be with him, but not now.",,,
770,I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine.,,,
770,"Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us.",,,
770,We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.,,,
771,Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year.,,,
771,We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out.,,,
771,But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me.,,,
771,Now he wants me to wait on him to mature.,,,
771,He wants to talk to other people.,,,
771,Then come back in four years.,,,
771,He doesn't want to deal with me while I'm pregnant.,,,
771,He doesn't take me to the doctor or anything.,,,
771,I feel alone.,,,
771,How do I handle this situation?,,,
772,I have several issues like I don't like people.,,,
772,They make me sick.,,,
772,I have issues with talking to people.,,,
772,I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me.,,,
772,I have felt this way for years.,,,
772,When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying.,,,
772,I just stay away from people to avoid this.,,,
772,I look at people and think how I could hurt them.,,,
772,I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in.,,,
772,Every day I wake up it's like another day.,,,
772,Any info would be good.,,,
773,"Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isn't the same.",,,
773,Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?,,,
774,I was in a relationship with him for three years.,,,
774,My mom doesn't like it because she thinks I'm making a mistake.,,,
774,"He got married a few months after we broke up, and now he is divorced.",,,
774,"I forgave him for what he did in the past, and he says he¡¯s sorry and he really loves me.",,,
774,"I love him too, but is it bad that I'm giving him a second chance again?",,,
775,I am currently living in a hotel and I don¡¯t have a family.,,,
775,I met a guy a month ago.,,,
775,He is a bisexual.,,,
775,He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites.,,,
775,He would not help pay for the room.,,,
775,"When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it.",,,
775,I slapped him and asked him to leave my room.,,,
775,We recently just got back together.,,,
775,One time I was sick.,,,
775,He came to visit and feed me but left no money.,,,
775,Then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that I have struggles living at a hotel.,,,
775,He says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever I need someone to have sex with.,,,
775,He left his bath soap so he could come and get it.,,,
775,I think that he is trying to find a way to come back.,,,
775,Please help me.,,,
775,What¡¯s going on?,,,
775,"I am a good, loyal woman.",,,
775,Why is he treating me like this?,,,
776,I got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years.,,,
776,We both fell in love and have been together for eight months.,,,
776,He left the house and filed for divorce.,,,
776,"He decided to tell her about our relationship, and she is willing to forgive and work on things.",,,
776,This shook him.,,,
776,They have two kids together.,,,
776,He decided to put the divorce on hold.,,,
776,He left town for a month to get clarity on the situation and see a therapist.,,,
777,"I have been dating my boyfriend for a month, and we want a baby.",,,
777,"We don't work or drive, and we haven't talked to our parents.",,,
777,What should we do?,,,
778,I was hanging out with my close guy friend.,,,
778,"We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything.",,,
778,We both just got out of relationships.,,,
778,His was very sexual.,,,
778,"I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that.",,,
778,"I want to be with him, but I'm not ready for another relationship, and I don't know if he ever will want to be more than friends.",,,
779,My partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process.,,,
779,It¡¯s especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him.,,,
779,I feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me.,,,
780,My girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because I said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers.,,,
780,"I have been trying to get her back, but it isn¡¯t easy.",,,
780,She is in her 50s and I am in my 40s.,,,
780,"She is the one I want for my life, and this is killing me.",,,
780,"Every day, I cry, and I am desperate for help.",,,
781,"I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend.",,,
781,"At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date.",,,
781,He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two.,,,
781,I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart.,,,
781,"He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.",,,
781,"Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year.",,,
781,He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her.,,,
781,But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves.,,,
781,"He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.",,,
781,He knows that I still crush on him.,,,
781,He doesn't rub it in my face.,,,
781,"He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us.",,,
781,How do I do that when the time comes?,,,
781,How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up?,,,
781,How do I make him feel better?,,,
781,"He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.",,,
782,I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year.,,,
782,"Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now.",,,
782,"Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day.",,,
782,"We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family.",,,
782,I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site.,,,
782,"When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: ¡°My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn¡¯t honest with you.",,,
782,You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life.,,,
782,I didn¡¯t realize you were still interested in dating.,,,
782,"Again, my apologies.¡± Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?",,,
783,My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years.,,,
783,We recently just broke up again last night on New Year¡¯s Eve.,,,
783,"When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened.",,,
783,She acts like everything is alright.,,,
783,This has been going on for two years.,,,
783,"I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man.",,,
783,She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man.,,,
783,It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants.,,,
783,She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her.,,,
783,"Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already?",,,
783,I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.,,,
784,I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful.,,,
784,He has since had a rebound relationship.,,,
784,He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me.,,,
784,He says it's going to be too difficult to see me.,,,
784,"Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him.",,,
784,"He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn¡¯t care less.",,,
784,I think I'm running him away.,,,
785,"I'm an early 20 something year-old virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids.",,,
785,He's cheated on me twice: once in the beginning and then four months ago.,,,
785,He wasn't use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasn't sure.,,,
785,We both work at the same job (where we met) and it¡¯s with the girl that works with us.,,,
785,"I've been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and self-esteem are low, and sometimes I feel like he¡¯ll do it again or that he's not ready to be with me.",,,
785,I think about it all over again when I see her.,,,
785,"He says he's in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it didn't feel right, and that's when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me.",,,
785,He's contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because he's in a relationship with me.,,,
785,How do I gain confidence?,,,
785,Should I let him go?,,,
785,"If I let him go, I don't want to be sad about it being that we work together.",,,
785,"I try to tell myself I'm beautiful every day, and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality, but I don't like the fact that she works there.",,,
786,"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship.",,,
786,I feel helpless and guilty.,,,
786,"I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.",,,
787,My boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago.,,,
787,"I love him, but his dog is wrecking my house.",,,
787,"Every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up (including the couch).",,,
787,"He's slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere.",,,
787,"Even though I come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance.",,,
787,I can't financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house.,,,
787,"I've tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well.",,,
787,The dog is the only thing we fight about because I want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesn't want to see him go.,,,
787,It¡¯s not the dog fault though; I understand that.,,,
787,"The dog is only a year old, and he isn't a bad dog.",,,
787,He's just too big of a dog for where he is; he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog.,,,
787,"I don't hate the dog, but I just can't afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.",,,
788,I had to go to the emergency room today to get an X-ray of my spine.,,,
788,My boyfriend didn't want to sit there and wait with me.,,,
788,"Instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited.",,,
788,"When I was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up.",,,
788,"He doesn't understand why I'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things.",,,
788,"He thinks I don't have a reason to be mad, but I believe that I do.",,,
789,My fianc¨¦ doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before.,,,
789,"However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with.",,,
789,What should I do?,,,
790,"My long-distance girlfriend is in a sorority, and it's changing her.",,,
790,I feel like I'm becoming less important to her and it hurts.,,,
790,"She just wants me to support the sorority, but it's so hard.",,,
790,"I try every day to show her she's the most important thing to me, but she can't even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that I won't worry about her doing anything regretful.",,,
790,"We love each other, but we're in a rough patch.",,,
791,"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend.",,,
791,"It¡¯s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure.",,,
791,"I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention.",,,
791,Nothing was ever wrong with it.,,,
791,"Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.",,,
791,"Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago.",,,
791,"I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s.",,,
791,"Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match.",,,
791,We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out.,,,
791,I tell him everything.,,,
791,"Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well.",,,
791,"He¡¯s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing.",,,
791,"That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off.",,,
791,"Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend.",,,
791,His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited.,,,
791,"I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run.",,,
791,They're supposed to move in together soon.,,,
791,"But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.",,,
791,I don't know what to do.,,,
791,I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this.,,,
791,"I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy.",,,
791,"I¡¯m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling.",,,
791,He¡¯s such a good person.,,,
791,"I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head.",,,
791,"I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing.",,,
791,I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.,,,
791,"I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face.",,,
791,"If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me.",,,
791,"If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed.",,,
791,"On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too.",,,
791,Where would I go from there?,,,
791,"On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this.",,,
791,"Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.",,,
791,"Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.",,,
792,"After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time.",,,
792,The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye.,,,
792,"My heart is burning, and I can't take this pain.",,,
793,My ex-boyfriend and I met over a year ago.,,,
793,We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick.,,,
793,"However, he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating.",,,
793,"When I found out I was pregnant, we had just broken up.",,,
793,"Five months later, I lost the baby, and we did not speak for a few weeks.",,,
793,"Now we are talking, and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him ""again.""",,,
793,"I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much, and I want to get back to us being happy and a family.",,,
794,"My ex-boyfriend, will not stop harassing and stalking me.",,,
794,We work together.,,,
794,I honestly think he needs help to move on.,,,
794,His accusations are angry lies.,,,
794,But I think he may believe them to be true.,,,
795,My boyfriend¡¯s sneaky and puts his friends before me.,,,
795,He fights just to leave.,,,
795,"One day, he's happy.",,,
795,"The next, he's mean and blames me for everything.",,,
795,He can't admit faults.,,,
795,He thinks he's perfect and does no wrong.,,,
796,My boyfriend says I'm nuts.,,,
796,I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me.,,,
796,"Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong.",,,
796,I know that accusing him does not help.,,,
796,"When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong.",,,
796,Am I wrong for feeling this way?,,,
796,I try to talk with him to make it better.,,,
796,I let him know when I am feeling down.,,,
796,But I am not confident in these things.,,,
796,Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him.,,,
796,"He texted her back with ""Sorry, I've been working.",,,
796,I just read your message.",,,
796,The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me.,,,
796,He texted her back with "Don't text me anymore.",,,
796,I don't feel like I am way out of the line.,,,
796,But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help.,,,
796,What should I do?,,,
796,How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?,,,
797,"I want us all to get along, but feel that I am not being respected.",,,
797,Of course I do have some insecurities because he was with his ex for 8 years.,,,
797,"He wants to see his step daughter and ex makes it so he has to go there to see her, but she doesn't want me around.",,,
797,"She has a boyfriend, but mine fixes their vehicles, goes over once a week and hangs out with the ex and does family things with her.",,,
797,"Since he works nights, I only see him parts of Friday-Sunday and we live together.",,,
797,"He won't let me use his phone when I forgot mine, says his ex used to mess with it.",,,
797,"I don't think he's cheating, but he will lie about what time he actually left her place to come home or about going over early to be with them.",,,
797,I feel like the other woman.,,,
797,She has tried to mess with holiday plans by restricting when he can see the child.,,,
797,"He only dated once person before her, so this could be why.",,,
797,I don't feel he has let go enough.,,,
797,He is a wonderful boyfriend other than this.,,,
798,Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me.,,,
798,This rollercoaster is crazy.,,,
799,"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl.",,,

799,But she says she still loves me.,,,
799,I'm very hurt and confused.,,,

801,"Then one day she says we should just be friends, but I can't stop thinking about her.",,,
801,She's always on mind and I want her back.,,,
802,I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice.,,,
802,Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him.,,,
802,Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating.,,,
802,"In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating.",,,
802,What advice might you offer?,,,
804,What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me.,,,
804,Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am.,,,
804,It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.,,,
805,He goes out with her to dinner/brunch/movies when we are not together (we live 2 hours apart).,,,

806,Intimacy fell off.,,,
806,I asked what's up.,,,
806,She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me.,,,
806,She used to be very open and expressive.,,,
806,Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching.,,,
806,"When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off.",,,
806,Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating.,,,
806,"She says otherwise, but I don't know.",,,
806,It just feels like something is really off.,,,
807,He is in his late thirties and I am in my mid twenties.,,,
807,We have been together for about 5 months.,,,
807,I really like him.,,,
807,He says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right.,,,
807,He has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear.,,,
807,I don't know if it's worth giving him a second chance.,,,
808,I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations.,,,
808,I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails.,,,
808,How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations?,,,
808,"I see someone in need of help, I jump in.",,,
808,And it is getting me nowhere.,,,
808,I am alone sad and frustrated.,,,
809,We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls.,,,

809,Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop.,,,
809,We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it.,,,
809,His wife (my good friend) saw us kiss once and told my husband.,,,

809,I decided to just tell my husband everything.,,,
809,We are trying to work things out.,,,
809,But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it.,,,
809,How can I help him believe me?,,,
810,I'm currently dating someone else and I really like him.,,,
810,But I love and miss my ex so much.,,,
810,What do I do?,,,

811,I need some help to save our family.,,,
812,I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about.,,,
812,How do I figure out what triggers me to do this?,,,

813,How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,,,
814,He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why.,,,
814,I love him very very much.,,,
814,He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all.,,,
814,I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better?,,,
814,"I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling.",,,
814,He's a great guy!,,,
814,I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me.,,,
814,He's starting to put less effort in talking to me.,,,
814,At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple.,,,
814,I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much.,,,
814,Advice on what to do?,,,

818,The problem is that I'm in love with a guy that I've been talking to for about 2 years but I've never met him in person.,,,
818,"Honestly I'm bored with the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy, I don't know how to tell him that.",,,
818,What should I do?,,,
819,I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years.,,,
819,"At first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, we'd break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times.",,,
819,We've also had two beautiful baby girls during this time.,,,
819,"Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I don't know how to please a man, when I work part-time, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook.",,,
819,"Sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet.",,,
819,"In addition, I have 2 boys and he has 1 son.",,,
819,I feel somewhere I have lost something.,,,
819,"It's not that I don¡¯t care, I truly love this guy, but I'm just tired of being the one who is always being judged.",,,
819,"Please, I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because I really need to speak to someone.",,,
820,Me and my girlfriend just broke up.,,,
820,She said she loves me but is not in love anymore.,,,
820,This came out of nowhere.,,,
820,We seemed so happy together.,,,
820,It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family.,,,
820,The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister¡¯s house everything changed.,,,
820,That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore.,,,
820,I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.,,,
820,Then she told me to come to her in Missouri.,,,
820,So that's what I did.,,,
820,"I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.",,,
820,Once I got there everything was fine again.,,,
820,She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week.,,,
820,Then she went back to saying she didn¡¯t love me anymore and had no feelings for me.,,,
820,The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant.,,,
820,This wasn¡¯t an accident.,,,
820,"We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept.",,,
820,I love her so much.,,,
820,I have never been bad to her.,,,
820,I've treated her the best I can.,,,
820,I wanted her to be my wife.,,,
820,I was going to propose to her when she got back.,,,
820,Now I'm losing my family and my mind.,,,
820,I don't know what to do.,,,
823,I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s.,,,
823,"I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private.",,,
823,I am torn on how to feel about it.,,,
823,I enjoy it very much.,,,
823,I have had a pantyhose/stocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young.,,,
823,I have no history of sexual abuse growing up.,,,
823,I am currently single.,,,
824,"After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex?",,,
824,I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.,,,
826,"I'm a girl, and I can't tell whether I'm bisexual or gay.",,,
826,"I like girls a little more than boys, but I don't really know.",,,
827,What should I do when we see each other?,,,
828,I was born a girl.,,,
828,I look like a boy.,,,
828,I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender.,,,
828,I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender.,,,
828,I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,,,
829,I've been going through a rough time lately.,,,
829,I been into nothing but women.,,,
829,I¡¯ve never thought about men until a week ago.,,,
829,I¡¯m very upset and depressed about this.,,,
829,It's not normal to me.,,,
829,I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I¡¯m not gay.,,,
829,"I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust.",,,
829,This is tough on me.,,,
829,I'm scared that I looked too many times.,,,
829,I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.,,,
830,I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now.,,,
830,This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start.,,,
830,I do not have the soundest information either.,,,
832,"In middle school and high school, my friends and family thought I was gay.",,,
832,"I tried telling them, but they wouldn¡¯t believe me.",,,
832,It almost feels like they wanted me to be.,,,
832,Now I¡¯m actually starting to believe them.,,,
832,"I know I wasn¡¯t back then, and now I¡¯m not sure anymore.",,,
834,I'm a guy.,,,
834,"If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?",,,
835,"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends.",,,
835,I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had.,,,
835,They just wouldn't accept it.,,,
835,My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own.,,,
835,I need some strategies for dealing with it.,,,
835,What should I do?,,,
836,I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples.,,,
836,"I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea.",,,
836,I also find guys cute too.,,,
836,Does this make me bisexual?,,,
837,I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights.,,,
837,I thought I was going to die.,,,
837,"Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female.",,,
837,I never had this desire before.,,,
837,All I can think about is being a woman.,,,
837,I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either.,,,
837,"Women are attractive, but not like before.",,,
837,I can also find men attractive now.,,,
837,I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.,,,
838,I'm a teenage girl.,,,
838,"I don't know if I'm straight, bisexual, or gay.",,,
838,"I've been straight all my life, but a sudden rush of questions have come over me, and I don't know anymore.",,,
839,I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.,,,
840,I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls.,,,
840,I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body.,,,
840,I imagine myself as a girl too.,,,
840,I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one.,,,
840,And I don't care about having boobs or anything.,,,
840,I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.,,,
843,Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me.,,,
843,"Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.",,,
843,How can I stop these thoughts?,,,
845,"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.",,,
846,"I'm a teenager, and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if I'm worried or upset.",,,
846,She "gives me advice" and comforts me and tells me it'll be okay.,,,
846,I've given her a name (Solace) and created a personality for her that's like a comforting motherly figure.,,,
846,"I know it's just my own advice and my own thoughts, but it's just that I'm thinking of them through a voice other than my own.",,,
846,"I do this because I know I never really listen to my own advice, and I thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out, through this imaginary friend.",,,
846,Is this normal?,,,
846,Could it develop into a separate personality with time if I continue a mentality that she is her own person?,,,
847,My daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying ¡°calm down¡± when she dropped her phone.,,,
847,"Within seconds, the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb, saying horrifically unspeakable things, and her calling the cops on me.",,,
847,She seems unable to stop herself at times.,,,
848,"One moment, I'm happy, and then a tiny thing happens and I feel so hurt and awful that I can't handle anything.",,,
848,"I cry and cry, then next morning, I'm happy.",,,
848,I'm so confused.,,,
849,I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms.,,,
849,Is that correct?,,,
850,I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD.,,,
850,Can counseling help me to get over it?,,,

853,How do I stop?,,,

854,My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do.,,,
854,When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene.,,,
854,"Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.",,,
854,Can you explain what's going on?,,,
855,"For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things.",,,
855,"They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.",,,
856,My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one.,,,
856,I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode.,,,
856,I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.,,,
860,People always judge others so rudely.,,,
861,I've developed a really intense and unexpected attraction to An actress after seeing her in a ballet uniform while guest starring on a television show.,,,
861,"I try, but I can't get her out of my mind.",,,
861,What should I do?,,,
862,I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships.,,,
862,How can I fix my underlying issues?,,,
863,I know I'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make.,,,
863,"I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just can't seem to even though I really want to.",,,
863,Why can't I force myself to change?,,,
864,I don't feel like myself anymore.,,,
864,"For example, I could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving.",,,
864,I feel like I¡¯m watching my life be lived by someone else.,,,

865,I'm not sure why I did it.,,,
865,My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.,,,
865,Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked.,,,
865,I don't know why I feel like this.,,,
865,Does this mean there is something wrong with me?,,,
866,"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him.",,,

868,I've felt this way for two years.,,,
868,"I feel so much better now then I did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.",,,
869,It's been like a couple of years that I've been feeling like this.,,,
869,"I don't want to self-diagnose, but I get so sad and cry and then I feel better.",,,
869,"But then I get upset with people so quickly, and I hurt their feelings.",,,
869,"It's this constant rollercoaster, and it's hard.",,,
871,I just need to know if I'm really crazy or not.,,,
872,I start to think of an issue that doesn't even matter or something bad that happened years ago.,,,

872,"In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody.",,,

873,"He refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends.",,,

873,He drives me to school and work every day and picks me up¡ªjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that he's not totally a horrible human being.,,,
873,Is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there?,,,
