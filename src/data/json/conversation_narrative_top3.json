I was informed that my answers would be crucial in assessing my emotional state.\n\nThe assessment started with a question about how often I've felt tired for no good reason in the past four weeks.

It's important to acknowledge these feelings and understand that seeking help is a positive step forward. \n\nThank you for completing the assessment. Your distress level is noted as 15, although the score is undefined out of 40. This score suggests a mild level of distress. It's important to remember that this assessment is a tool to help understand your feelings better and should be considered within the broader context of your life and experiences. \n\nPlease remember that these results must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context by a suitably qualified individual and should never be used as a sole means of diagnosis. For more detailed information and to understand the next steps you might consider, please visit [The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) information page](https://novopsych.com.au/assessments/outcome-monitoring/the-kessler-psych\nu: ohkaayyy then what am I supposed to do now??\na: Given what you've shared about your feelings and experiences, it might be helpful to explore some steps you can take to address these challenges. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Continue Seeking Professional Support**: Since you've already seen doctors and were referred to a psychiatrist, continuing down this path could be beneficial. Mental health professionals can offer more personalized advice and treatment options, including therapy or medication if needed.\n\n2. **Self-Care Practices**: Incorporating self-care practices into your daily routine can help manage stress and improve your overall well-being. This can include activities you mentioned help you calm down, like listening to your favorite songs, as well as other practices like exercise, mindfulness, or journaling.\n\n3. **Building a Support System**: It sounds like feeling isolated is a part of what you're experiencing. Finding ways to connect with others, whether through support groups, friends, family, or community activities, can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of loneliness.\n\n4. **Setting Small, Achie\nu: But where do I go from here?\na: Moving forward from where you are now involves taking small, manageable steps. Here's a plan to help guide you:\n\n1. **Follow Up with Mental Health Professionals**: Since you've been referred to a psychiatrist, it's important to follow through with that referral. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and discuss treatment options that might include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. If you haven't already scheduled an appointment, making that a priority could be a helpful next step.\n\n2. **Explore Support Networks**: You mentioned feeling like you have no one to talk to. Exploring local or online support groups for individuals going through similar experiences can be incredibly validating and reduce feelings of isolation. These groups can provide a sense of community and shared understanding that is hard to find elsewhere.\n\n3. **Engage in Activities That Bring You Joy**: You've mentioned that listening to your favorite songs helps you calm down. Expanding on this, try to engage in other activities that bring you joy or at least provide",
        "narrative": "I reached out for help after being referred by two GPs to a psychiatrist at a public hospital. The moment I knew I needed help was when I experienced seven different emotions within an hour, ranging from sadness to laughter. This year has been tough, with a significant job change that altered not just my responsibilities but also the entire work environment and culture. On top of that, I've been dealing with personal emotional issues.\n\nAt work, I've tried to compartmentalize my emotions, pushing thoughts away to feel numb, but it's not working. My performance has suffered; I'm making mistakes on tasks I've done countless times before. My colleagues have noticed and even conducted multiple background checks on me. It feels like they hired one person and got a shell of me instead. I question myself constantly but find no answers. I can't focus, and there are days when I'm physically present but can't remember what I did.\n\nI was told that changing jobs is a significant stressor and that it's normal to feel overwhelmed. It's also concerning to experience such a wide range of emotions so frequently. The strategy of compartmentalizing emotions at work can be exhausting and isn't always effective. It's tough when you're not performing to your own standards, and feedback from colleagues can add to that stress. I was reminded that seeking help is a strong step towards understanding and managing these feelings.\n\nFeeling isolated and having no one to talk to, I was asked a series of questions about my feelings over the past four weeks. I felt tired only a little, wasn't nervous at all, and didn't experience extreme nervousness since I usually listen to my favorite songs to calm down. I haven't felt hopeless, which is a positive sign. I've felt a little restless and fidgety, but not to the point where I couldn't sit still. I haven't felt depressed, and while I believe everything requires effort, I admitted that sometimes tasks felt more difficult than usual. I've felt a little sad, but not to the point where nothing could cheer me up, and I haven't felt worthless.\n\nBased on the assessment, my distress level was noted as 15 out of 40, suggesting a mild level of distress. It was emphasized that this assessment should be considered within the broader context of my life and experiences and interpreted by a qualified individual.\n\nWondering what to do next, I was advised to continue seeking professional support, incorporate self-care practices, build a support system, and set small, achievable goals. Moving forward involves following up with mental health professionals, exploring support networks, and engaging in activities that bring me joy."

        "narrative": "I've been feeling aimless in life lately, seeing no point in living. I reached out for someone to talk to about this overwhelming sense of purposelessness.

Depression has been a frequent visitor, and I've felt that everything was an effort all of the time. Sadness has been my companion most of the time, making me feel worthless.\n\nAfter sharing my feelings, I was told that my score indicated a high level of psychological distress and that it would be best to seek professional support. I was provided with various resources for immediate assistance and encouraged to contact a helpline during office hours to speak with a counselor.\n\nI was reassured that reaching out for help is a brave step towards feeling better and that I'm not alone in this. I was reminded that it's okay to not be okay and that asking for help is a sign of strength. In the end, I asked for coping strategies to help me manage until I could get professional help."

I'm truly sorry you're going through such a difficult time. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and there is support available to help you through this. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it might be beneficial to speak with a professional who can provide you with the support and guidance you need. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) offers a 24-hour emergency hotline at 6389 2003/6389 2004, and their website provides additional resources: https://www.imh.com.sg/Clinical-Services/Pages/Emergency-Services.aspx. \n\nWould you be open to reaching out to them or another support service?\nu: I don't want to go to IMH\nu: that is why I am here\nu:  to talk to someone\na: I understand, and I'm here for you. It's okay if you're not ready to reach out to IMH or similar services right now. Let's focus on what we can do together at this moment. Talking about what you're going through can be a good step forward. \n\nYou mentioned hearing voices that are harsh and critical, and feeling a range of difficult emotions most of the time. These experiences sound incredibly challenging, but sharing them is a brave and important step. \n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any particular way I can support you right now? Remember, this is a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings.\nu: thank you\na: You're welcome. I'm here for you. If there's anything more you'd like to share or discuss, please feel free. Remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to seek help and talk about what you're going through. If you ever feel ready or think it might be helpful, there are resources and people ready to support you. But for now, let's focus on what you need in this moment. How can I assist you further today?\nu: sometimes when I am in the middle of doing something the voices would come\na: It sounds really challenging to have those interruptions, especially when you're trying to focus on something. It can be very distressing to deal with voices that come unexpectedly. \n\nWould you like to share more about what happens when the voices come while you're in the middle of doing something? How do you usually respond or cope with these moments?\nu: I try to ignore it but it is hard\na: It's understandable that trying to ignore the voices is hard. It takes a lot of strength to attempt to manage them on your own. Finding coping strategies that work for you is important, and it's okay to explore different ways to help yourself during those moments.\n\nSome people find it helpful to engage in an activity that requires focus or relaxation techniques to help distract from or manage the voices. This could be anything from deep breathing, listening to music, or even stepping outside for a moment. \n\nHave you found anything that helps, even a little, during those times?\nu: yes sometimes I turn out really loud music to drown them out\na: Using loud music to drown out the voices sounds like a coping mechanism that offers you some relief. It's good that you've found something that helps, even if it's just for a little while. Music can be a powerful tool for managing difficult moments.\n\nIf you're open to it, exploring additional coping strategies alongside the music might provide you with more ways to manage when the voices feel overwhelming. Some people find activities like writing, drawing, or physical exercise helpful in redirecting their focus. \n\nIt's also important to consider reaching out for support from a mental health professional who can work with you to develop personalized strategies for managing these experiences. They can offer guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring other coping strategies or activities that might help you manage these moments?\nu: but I can't always do that\na: I understand, relying solely on loud music isn't always feasible or enough to manage the voices effectively all the time. It's important to have a variety of strategies to help you cope in different situations. \n\nHere are a few additional strategies you might consider:\n1. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: These practices can help ground you in the present moment and may reduce the impact of the voices.\n2. **Physical Activity**: Engaging in physical exercise, even something as simple as a walk, can help shift your focus and reduce stress.\n3. **Creative Outlets**: Drawing, writing, or engaging in any form of creative expression can offer a distraction and a way to express what you're experiencing.\n4. **Talking to Someone**: Sometimes, just talking about what you're experiencing with a trusted friend, family member, or professional can provide relief.\n\nIt's also beneficial to explore professional support options. A mental health professional can work with you to understand your experiences better and develop a personalized plan to manage\nu: ok\nu: I can give it a try\na: That's great to hear. Trying out different strategies is a positive step forward. Remember, it's okay if not everything works right away or feels helpful. The key is to keep exploring and find what works best for you. \n\nAnd please know, you're not alone in this. There are people who want to support you, including professionals who understand what you're going through. If you ever feel ready to seek professional help, it can be a valuable resource in finding more ways to manage and understand your experiences.\n\nIf you have any questions, need someone to talk to, or want more information about anything we've discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.\nu: thank you\nu: so back to my original question...\nu: am I going crazy?\na: Feeling like you're \"going crazy\" is a common way many people describe their experiences when they're dealing with things that are hard to understand or manage, like hearing voices. It's important to know that experiencing such things doesn't mean you're going crazy. Many people have similar experiences at some point in their lives due to various reasons, including stress, lack of sleep, or more significant mental health challenges.\n\nWhat you're going through is a sign that you're facing some difficulties right now, but it's also a sign that it might be a good time to seek support. Seeking help is a strong and positive step towards understanding what's happening and finding ways to feel better. Remember, there are professionals who have worked with many others who've had similar experiences, and they can offer support and guidance.\n\nYou're taking important steps by acknowledging what you're going through and reaching out to talk about it. That takes courage. You're not alone, and there are ways to navigate through this.\nu: thanks\nu: I feel a bit better now\na: I'm really glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better. It's great that you reached out to talk about what you've been going through. Remember, it's okay to seek support and there are people who want to help you through this. Taking things one step at a time is important, and you've already taken a significant step today.\n\nIf you ever need to talk again or have more questions, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here for you. Take care of yourself, and remember, you're not alone in this journey.\nu: thanks for the chat\na: You're welcome! I'm glad we could chat. Remember, you can reach out anytime you need to talk or have questions. Take care, and I wish you all the best on your journey.",

        "narrative": "I reached out to a chatline for help because I was feeling incredibly tired, especially after four days of training. I didn't get a chance to rest because I had to go back to work immediately after the trainings. The exhaustion was compounded by the fact that it was also the fasting month, which meant I had to manage work, training, and fasting all at once.\n\nThe person on the chatline was understanding and asked me a series of questions to gauge my emotional well-being over the past four weeks. I knew I couldn't skip fasting despite the tiredness, and I admitted to feeling tired most of the time. However, I didn't feel nervous, restless, hopeless, or depressed. I was just physically worn out. They offered me some practical tips for managing tiredness during fasting, like eating balanced meals, staying hydrated, taking short naps, and listening to my body.\n\nWe also discussed the importance of Tarawih prayers during this holy month and finding a balance to maintain my spiritual duties while taking care of my physical health. The person on the chatline was respectful and supportive, offering to help regardless of my background or beliefs.\n\nThen, I opened up about feeling invisible sometimes, like no one really saw me. I had tried speaking louder to get attention, but it only worked momentarily before I was ignored again. They reassured me that my efforts were valid and reminded me that my worth isn't defined by the attention I receive from others. I learned about intrinsic value, which means being valuable just by being myself, independent of others' recognition.\n\nTo increase my feeling of self-worth, they suggested acknowledging my achievements, practicing self-compassion, engaging in activities I enjoy, surrounding myself with supportive people, and setting personal goals. I found this advice very useful and was reminded that building self-worth is a journey that I can take one step at a time. They encouraged me to reach out whenever I needed more support or had further questions."

My intention was to understand your situation better so I could offer more tailored support. It's clear that you're going through a difficult time, and I want to help you in a way that feels meaningful to you. Let's focus on what you feel would be most helpful right now. How can I assist you better?\nu: how can I get out of this state\na: Getting out of this state can be challenging, but there are steps you can take to start feeling better. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Seek Professional Help**: A mental health professional can provide you with the tools and strategies to cope with how you're feeling. They can offer a safe space to explore these feelings and work on strategies to improve your mental health.\n\n2. **Connect with Others**: Sometimes, talking to friends or family members about how you're feeling can provide relief and a sense of being understood. If you're not ready to talk to someone close to you, consider joining a support group where you can connect with others experiencing similar feelings.\n\n3. **Focus on Self-Care**: Taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental health. Try to get enough sleep, eat nutritious foods, and engage in physical activity that you enjoy. Even small steps can make a difference.\n\n4. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: When you're feeling aimless\nu: this is too much information\na: I understand that it can feel overwhelming. Let's simplify and focus on one small step you can take. How about starting with something that usually brings you a bit of comfort or peace, even if it's small? It could be listening to a favorite song, stepping outside for a few minutes, or even just taking a few deep breaths. What's one thing you feel you could do right now?\nu: can you break it down for me\na: Absolutely, let's break it down into simpler, more manageable steps:\n\n1. **Breathe**: Start with taking some deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Do this a few times.\n\n2. **One Small Activity**: Think of one small activity that you usually enjoy or find relaxing. It could be as simple as making a cup of tea, looking at pictures that make you smile, or watching a short video of something you find interesting or funny.\n\n3. **Reach Out**: Consider sending a message to a friend or family member. You don't have to talk about how you're feeling if you're not ready. Sometimes just a casual chat can be a good distraction.\n\n4. **Daily Goal**: Set one small, achievable goal for tomorrow. It could be anything from taking a short walk, reading a page of a book, or trying a new hobby for a few minutes.\n\n5.\nu: I am feeling overwhelmed and can't read so much\na: I'm sorry for overwhelming you. Let's focus on just one thing:\n\n**Breathe**. Take a slow breath in, hold it, and then let it out slowly. Do this a few times.\n\nWhen you're ready, we can talk about the next step. Just focus on breathing for now.\nu: ok\na: Take your time. Remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. If you want to talk more or try another step when you're ready, I'm here.\nu: I feel a tightness in my chest when I do that\na: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to address physical discomfort, especially when it's related to your emotions. If the tightness persists or is concerning, it might be a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional to ensure everything is okay physically.\n\nFor now, let's try a different approach that doesn't focus on your breathing. How about finding a comfortable place to sit or lie down, and gently focus on a specific object in the room? It could be anything\u9225\u6501 picture on the wall, the texture of a fabric, or even the feeling of the ground beneath your feet. This can help ground you in the present moment without putting pressure on your breathing.\n\nRemember, I'm here to support you.\nu: you mean do this now?\na: Yes, if you're comfortable giving it a try now, please do. Find a comfortable spot and gently focus on something in your surroundings. It's a way to help distract your mind from overwhelming thoughts and ease the physical discomfort you're feeling. Take your time, and there's no pressure to rush. I'm here for you.\nu: thank you\na: You're welcome. Take all the time you need, and remember, I'm here whenever you're ready to talk or if you have any questions. Your well-being is important, and you're not alone in this.\nu: okay I have done it\na: I'm glad to hear that you tried it. How are you feeling now? Remember, it's okay to take small steps and to take care of yourself at your own pace.\nu: I feel a bit better but it doesn't solve the problem that I feel nothing matters in life\na: It's understandable that these feelings won't disappear immediately, but I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit better. The sense that nothing matters can be deeply challenging, but it's also something many people work through with support and time. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some ways to find meaning or small things that might bring you a sense of purpose or joy, even if they seem very small right now? It's okay if you're not sure where to start; we can explore this together at a pace that feels right for you.\nu: okay\na: Great, taking that step to say \"okay\" is already a positive move. Let's start with something simple. Think about activities or moments in the past that brought you even a tiny bit of joy or satisfaction. It doesn't have to be something big; even small moments count. \n\nFor example, have you ever enjoyed nature, music, a particular show, or maybe a hobby like drawing or writing? Sometimes, reconnecting with these small joys can be a starting point to finding a sense of purpose or meaning again.\n\nIs there anything that comes to mind, no matter how small it may seem?\nu: well I used to enjoy hanging out with friends\na: That's a good starting point. Spending time with friends can bring a lot of joy and a sense of connection. Given how you've been feeling, it might seem challenging to reach out, but perhaps we could think about a small step towards reconnecting with them. \n\nMaybe you could send a message to a friend you trust, just to say hi or share something light, like a funny meme or a memory you cherish. It doesn't have to be about how you're feeling right now unless you want it to be. Sometimes, just the act of reconnecting can lift our spirits a bit.\n\nWould you feel comfortable trying something like that?\nu: yes I suppose a message is doable\na: That sounds like a positive step. Sending a simple message can be a great way to start reconnecting. Remember, there's no pressure for it to lead to anything more than a brief exchange if that's all you're up for right now. \n\nAfter you've sent the message, take a moment to acknowledge the step you've taken. It's a brave and significant move towards feeling better. \n\nIf you're up for it later, consider what other small steps you might take to engage with activities or people that used to bring you joy. And remember, I'm here to talk through any of this whenever you need.\nu: ok\na: I'm here for you whenever you need to talk or if you have any questions. Take care, and remember, taking even the smallest step is a move in the right direction. You're not alone in this.\nu: thanks\na: You're welcome. Remember, you can reach out anytime. Take care of yourself, and be gentle with your progress. Wishing you all the best.\nu: thanks\na: You're welcome. Take care, and remember, I'm here if you need to talk again. Wishing you strength and peace.",
        "narrative": "I've been feeling aimless and see no point in living, which led me to seek someone to talk to. I was reassured that it was okay to feel this way and was encouraged to share more about my feelings. I admitted that I find no joy in anything I do, which was acknowledged as a deep sense of disconnection from activities I once enjoyed. I was thanked for being brave enough to express how I was feeling, but I couldn't shake the worry that something might be wrong with me.\n\nTo better understand my situation, I was asked a series of questions about my feelings over the past four weeks. I felt tired most of the time, a little nervous, but never so nervous that nothing could calm me down. I felt hopeless all of the time, sometimes restless or fidgety, but never so restless I couldn't sit still. I was depressed most of the time, felt that everything was an effort all of the time, and was so sad that nothing could cheer me up most of the time. I also felt worthless all of the time.\n\nWhen I expressed frustration at just being asked questions without receiving help, I was offered suggestions to get out of this state, such as seeking professional help, connecting with others, focusing on self-care, and setting small, achievable goals. However, feeling overwhelmed by too much information, I asked for a simpler approach. I was then guided to focus on one thing at a time, starting with breathing exercises. When I felt a tightness in my chest, I was advised to find a comfortable place and gently focus on something in my surroundings to ground myself in the present moment.\n\nAfter trying this, I felt a bit better but still struggled with the feeling that nothing matters in life. I was open to exploring ways to find meaning or small things that might bring joy. I recalled enjoying hanging out with friends and was encouraged to take a small step towards reconnecting with them, like sending a simple message. I agreed that sending a message was doable.\n\nI was reminded that I'm not alone and that taking even the smallest step is a move in the right direction. I was offered support and reassurance that I could reach out anytime, and I was wished strength and peace."
